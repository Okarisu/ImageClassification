You can have multiple models trained and use the most adequate to what type of images you want to process.


## Usage

### Workflow

This program composes several utilities that are to be used in specific order:

- renaming the training images
- assigning tags to them
- training the model
- classifying images
- sorting images

#### Renaming

Place the 
Use `--rename`

### Running compiled code

Unzip the release zip file and run the binary file. It first downloads the [inception5h](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/inception5h.zip) model to its data folder.
Then, 

### Compiling yourself

##
- `--init` - creates system folders
